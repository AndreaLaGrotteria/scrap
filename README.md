# SCRAP

Seismic collapse response prediction of steel moment resisting frames 

## Code Structure
The data processing and model training can be found in code.ipynb

The datasets needed to run the notebook are also provided in the repository.

## Setup
We assume a working Anaconda installation. 

To create the environment run `conda create -n scrap python=3.11.6 pandas=2.1.1 numpy=1.24.3 matplotlib=2.1.3 seaborn=0.12.2 scikit-learn=1.3.0 shap=0.43.0` and then `conda activate scrap`. Finally run `jupyter notebook` to start the notebook.
